# GenomicPrediction


rrBLUP genomic prediction and K fold cross-validation

To evaluate the effects of deleterious mutations, the value of each phenotypic trait (Z-scores) was predicted by the genomic prediction model, in which the direction of PAV loci was allow to vary from 0 to 100 percent random absent alleles at 1% intervals for a total of 100 predictions.
